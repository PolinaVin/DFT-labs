 SYSTEM = Hello World

Electronic relaxation
 ENCUT = 400    ! cutoff energy (eV)
 ALGO = fast    ! algorithm for electronic optimizations
 EDIFF = 1E-4   ! energy convergence criterion (eV) up to 10^-7-8

Ionic Relaxation
 EDIFFG = -0.01 ! residual forces acting on atoms (minus means forces condition)
 IBRION = 1     ! use the conjugate gradient algorithm
 NSW = 100      ! ionic steps (0 if no atoms transfer)

 ISMEAR = 0     ! Gaussian smearing of delta functions
